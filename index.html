                       you need to bite the bullet and learn a couple of new skills. 
                      Even though websites have become easier for non-technical folks to update, they still require an unnecessary amount of 
                      know-how, time and budget just to simply keep them up and running.</p>

                       and converts your audience.</p>
                    <h3>What will I get and how will I benefit?</h3>
                    <h4>Website - The Essential Hub of your Digital Marketing</h4>
                    <p>A website that is served over a secure (HTTPS) connection at lightening speed. Security and speed are important to your visitors and the search engines will reward you. 
                      Page load speed is a very important factor for holding the attention of visitors. Google will consider page load speed 
                      when deciding you ranking. A secure connection ensures that data passing between your website and the visitors browser 
                      cannot be intercepted or tampered with by 3rd parties. Google is keen for the web to be a safe place so will recommend 
                      sites served securely before those that are insecure. Worse still some web browser software will warn if the content is insecure which does not good for your reputation.</p>                    
                    <h4>Content Management System(CMS) with full version control </h4>
                    <p>A Content Management System allows you to manage your website using a web browser from anywhere with internet connectivity. The content and your website 
                      layout templates are stored in a secure online repository(a collection of folders) with a version control system. The CMS connects securely to the repository 
                      to allow you to make changes to your website source files. When you save your changes your website is built from the source files and published live to the cloud hosting.
                       The built in version control allows you to easily revert back to a previous version of your website if you inadvertantly publish some incorrect content. 
                       Unlike the more commonly used Dynamic CMS systems like wordPress, Joomla! and Drupal your CMS is not hosted with your website nor does it require the use of a complex database 
                      management system.</p>

                    <h4>Web Hosting - Scalable and Distributed</h4>
                    <p>Your website will be hosted on a Content Delivery Network(CDN) with Multiple Data Centres around the globe (nodes). Visitors to your website will be served from the node
                      closest to their location resulting in faster page loads. If one node is unable to serve requests, traffic is re-routed to an alternative node.
                      By contrast traditional web hosting serves all traffic from one point which, when traffic spikes, can become unresponsive until the back-log of 
                      requests is served or dropped. </p>
                      <p>In brief your site hosted on a CDN requires almost zero maintenace, is secure, scales well and is always available. A traditional dynamic CMS system hosted on a traditional server
                        is less able to deal with heavy load, is slower to serve pages(it needs to build them first) and requires regular updates and security patches costing the owners time or money.
                      <!-- Combine this with a dynamic system whch must fetch data from the database and assemble the page before delivery 
                      and you can see how much slower a traditional CMS system can be.
                      A fix for these folks is to spend more money on very specialist hosting, something you won't need to do. The cloud hosting via CDN is maintenace free, more secure and scales to almost limitless traffic. Dynamic systems require constant security patches to database and code. Scaling a dynamic 
                      website requires specialist(expensive) hosting. Dynamic websites by there nature take longer to deliver a page as they build it when requested before delivery. You site is already built so just need to deliver.</p> -->

            </div>
            <div class="col-md-8">
              <h3>How do you make the right choices when it comes to launching a new website?</h3>
                    <p>Over more than 20 years, we have seen all the mistakes. 
                      People launch a website that talks only about themselves.
                      Others launch a brochure website that never changes and does not help the business marketing efforts.
                      People fall out with their "web guy" and lose control of their domain. To sort out the problem, they get 
                      involved with a new "web guy", only to have similar problems with him in the future.
                      We see the brave folk who go it alone with WordPress but, later, regret their choice when they spend 
                      far too much time on maintenance. Or others who go with the online drag and drop site builder systems. 
                      They can quickly build a site but then, as requirements change, they find that these "one size fits all" 
                      packages are not flexible enough. The choice then is to do nothing, pay more to add a feature or manage the 
                      hassle of moving their website to another platform.</p>
                      <h3>Unsurprisingly, we have a view on all this.</h3>
                      <p>Most folks start from the wrong place. They obsess about how the website is going to look. Most offerings out 
                        there know this and make it ‘2 click’ simple for new customers to get going with a sexy looking template. All 
                        template demos have wonderful images and typefaces that make them look extremely appealing. The first thing you 
                        need to do with a template is add your own images and your own copy and then look at the template with fresh eyes. 
                        Does it look so eye poppingly beautiful with your logo and photos? Does it need to look like the template demo? </p>
                      <p>Don’t get bogged down with pixel perfect design. A perfect design on your desktop is going to look vastly different on a 
                          much smaller smart-phone screen. Not all visitors arrive to your website via the home page. Does it really need to look 
                          like a triumphal arch?</p>
                      <p> Visitors to your website do not have a preconceived idea about what they are going to find. So if 
                          your logo is red or blue probably hasn’t crossed their mind. Most visitors don’t care so much about you and your image. 
                          Visitors are focused on their own issues and getting a solution.</p>
                      <p>Your website needs to reflect this. Make information easy to find. Don’t hide your important content in an ocean of clever 
                         dancing widgets. Help visitors find what they want quickly and easily and they will repay you with their attention and loyalty.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="col-md-8">
                <h3>A website based on professionally designed templates.</h3>
                <p>Using a template for your website design saves a lot of time and money. Templates keep the design of the website and the content separate. 
                You can easily create content of various types with various different layouts. In the future, new content types and new layouts can be 
                added to suite your needs. The templating languages are very clean and can be easily managed by people with a little knowledge of plain 
                HTML markup language. This gives you maximum flexibility as you are not locked into a complicated system that requires expensive specialists. 
                All the components of the website are stored in simple text files making them easy to backup or move. Well designed templates are structured 
                in such a way that they lend themselves to easy modification for different purposes. Even though two websites may be based on the same template, 
                they can look very different.</p>
                <h3>A website that loads quickly.</h3>
                Why is this important?
                <p>A fast loading website is important for maintaining visitors’ attention. Do you like to wait? Neither do your visitors. A slow loading page makes visitors abandon your website and direct their attention elsewhere. Visitors prefer to find the information that helps them achieve their goals as quickly as possible. Nobody is interested in your fancy design flourishes especially when they increase the page load time. Google is aware of this and considers page load speed when ranking your content.</p>
                <h3>A website that displays correctly on all screen sizes.</h3>
                Why is this important?
                <p>A page that doesn’t display correctly appears broken. Visitors don’t trust broken websites and don’t have the patience to figure out how to make it work. Google now considers the mobile version of a website more important than the desktop version. Their intimate knowledge of the internet shows them that more people are now using mobile devices to view the web. If the mobile version of your website is too slow or displays poorly on mobile displays, Google will not give you a top score and your website will not feature as prominently in the search results.</p>
                <h3>A Content Management System (CMS) that will allow you to easily and quickly add or edit content on your website.</h3>
                Why do you need this?
                <p>In the digital age your business needs to be agile. You need to keep on top of your digital marketing. Your audience has an appetite for accurate helpful information. If you cannot react quickly to events in your industry, you will lose out to your more nimble competitors. A simple to use CMS that allows you to publish new content or edit existing content is essential. We set up a CMS that suites your needs. Also, in the future, as better CMSs become available we will be able to switch it for you without any loss of service. We want all our customers to be ahead of the pack when it comes to digital marketing.</p>
                <h3>Robust web hosting on a Content Delivery Network (CDN) with multiple data centres.</h3>
                Why is this desirable?
                <p>When your website is uploaded to a CDN the files are replicated to numerous data centres around the world. This puts your content closer to your audience’s physical location. Your website is always available. If one data centre is unavailable, requests for your content will be diverted to the healthy data centres and visitors will get the content they asked for. Traditional websites that are served from one server would be unable to serve content, if the server had problems.</p>
                <h3>Version Control - a full history of all changes to your website is stored.</h3>
                Why is this good?
                <p>If changes to your website cause problems, something displays incorrectly or some incorrect content gets published to the live site, you can instantly roll back to a an older version of your site. This allows you to fix the problems without any more of your visitors seeing your mistake.</p>
                <h3>A Website Secured by a Transport Layer Security/Secure Sockets Layer (TLS/SSL) Certificate. Green ‘Secure’ messages in the visitor’s browser.</h3>
                What happens if you don’t have this?
                <p>A secure connection between your visitor’s browser and your website ensures that all data packets travelling between the two are encrypted. Encrypted data packets can’t be opened and read by criminals. Google announced that websites that do not encrypt connections will not feature so prominently in search results. Modern Web Browsers warn visitors if the connection is not secure. Your business doesn’t need this adverse attention. Much better that visitors see the positive green ‘secure’ message.</p>
                <h3>A build and publish process which triggers automatically when you save changes to your content.</h3>
                Why is this good?
                <p>Once you save changes to your content in the CMS a new build and publish process will be automatically triggered. The build process takes your content and converts it into a website. If anything happens that causes the build to fail, the site is not published and the current website is not overwritten. You will be notified if the build fails but you won’t have to worry about a broken website.</p>
